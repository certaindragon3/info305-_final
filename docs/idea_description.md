I plan to build a small virtual archive around 阿成饭店, a neighborhood Suzhou eatery just off 十全街 that has quietly served classic Su cuisine for 26 years. Unlike celebrated Michelin-listed kitchens, this is an under-recognized, community restaurant cherished mainly by local elders. It is entering a sensitive moment: the chef-owner is retiring, the space is due for renovation, and stewardship is passing to his son. I will document four to five less known labor-intensive dishes—such as “樱桃肉”, “姑苏母油鸭”, and “响油鳝糊”—along with the tacit techniques (stock building, fire control, knife work) and the stories that surround them.
This topic matters to me because 阿成饭店 fed my everyday life. My primary through high-school years unfolded within a kilometer of its door; my family marked milestones there; I learned what “authentic Suzhou taste” means at its tables. What is at stake is more than recipes. Rising costs, the prevalence of premade food, and younger diners’ tilt toward spicier Sichuan/Hunan flavors are squeezing out the slow, subtle idiom of Su cuisine. If these techniques don’t get recorded now, they may become impossible to revive later.
Access is practical within seven weeks. I have a strong relationship with the owner and expect permission to conduct interviews, photograph workflows, capture time-coded cooking videos, scan aging menus/utensils, and collect patrons’ oral histories. The resulting archive will foreground a modest place to preserve know-how that might otherwise vanish during this transition.
