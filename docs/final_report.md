Title: A Virtual Micro‑Museum for Suzhou Cuisine: Documenting Acheng Fandian’s Craft, Space, and Transmission through Interactive Media

Abstract
This report documents the conception, design, and implementation of an interactive, web‑based micro‑museum that preserves and interprets culinary knowledge at Acheng Fandian (阿成饭店), a neighborhood Suzhou eatery in continuous operation for roughly twenty‑six years. We combine fieldwork—on‑site observation, photography, short‑form video, and a semi‑structured interview—with a dual‑pipeline 3D capture workflow and a high‑performance web stack to render four representative Su cuisine dishes and their tacit techniques. Framing food as cultural identity and practice, we situate the project within interactive heritage discourse and human–food digital narration, and reflect on the affordances and limits of our approach. We conclude with contributions, constraints, and future directions, including longitudinal documentation and a full‑day documentary that follows supply chains, front‑/back‑of‑house interactions, and service choreography from opening to closing.[^1][^2]

1. Introduction
Acheng Fandian (阿成饭店) is a modest, community‑anchored restaurant near Shiquan Street in Suzhou. As the founder prepares an intergenerational handover, the shop faces pressures common to small, technique‑intensive kitchens in contemporary China: rising costs, shifting taste preferences, and standardization through premade components. Our project builds a public, scholarly resource to preserve selected dishes—such as 松鼠桂鱼 (squirrel fish), 荷塘小炒 (lotus pond stir‑fry), 碧螺虾仁 (Biluochun tea shrimp), and 响油鳝糊 (hot oil eel)—together with tacit criteria, spatial routines, and oral histories that root technique in situated practice.

We approach cuisine as cultural practice: an ensemble of skills, materials, and meanings that index identity and memory. Interactive digital narration has proved effective at engaging visitors in culinary heritage by connecting bodily knowing—for example, the role of hands in cooking and eating—to multimodal content delivery. This research guides our interface emphasis on embodied attention and exploratory manipulation.[^1] In parallel, we adapt methods from digital heritage projects that hybridize research and performance to bridge archival cultural materials and contemporary media technologies, a strategy that legitimizes creative reconstruction when direct access is constrained.[^2]

2. Background and Motivation
Personal ties and community relevance motivate the work. Acheng Fandian fed the everyday life of the project team; it is where “Suzhou taste” was learned in practice and memory. More broadly, fine‑grained Su cuisine techniques face attrition. Premade food supply chains compress time and skill; younger diners often prefer spicier profiles associated with other regional cuisines; and the economics of slow, subtle dishes are increasingly difficult to sustain. Without documentation, know‑how may become irrecoverable as tacit cues and embodied routines pass with retiring chefs.

The project’s core idea is therefore modest, urgent, and scalable: to construct a durable, browsable micro‑archive around a single restaurant at a moment of transition, capturing dishes, tacit technique, and social meaning before they dissipate. By focusing on one site, we aim for depth, specificity, and transferability of patterns that other neighborhood kitchens could adopt with minimal infrastructure (idea_description.md).

3. Related Work
Two strands guide our approach. First, human‑centered interactive systems for food culture demonstrate that engaging, hands‑on narration can connect visitors to regional culinary traditions, transforming entertainment‑oriented interfaces into culturally meaningful experiences that emphasize embodied interaction.[^1] Second, interdisciplinary heritage work shows how contemporary technologies—fabrication, physical modeling, and media performance—can render otherwise inaccessible cultural traces sensible to modern audiences. This offers a methodological parallel to our translation of tacit kitchen craft into interactive 3D, annotated video, and bilingual text.[^2]

4. Fieldwork Site and Methods
4.1 Site
The restaurant’s street‑level frontage draws regulars rather than destination diners; signage is plain and consonant with a value proposition of affordability and freshness “as the first gate to guard.” Inside, the dining room is utilitarian. The back‑of‑house comprises prep (初加工), a steam and stew bench (蒸板), a sauté line (梅炉/炒灶), and plating (打荷), a division of labor the owner described as indispensable for complex dishes. These micro‑geographies shape activity sequences and directly condition where cameras, microphones, and lights could be placed without interrupting service (fieldworkreport.md).

4.2 Data Collection
We conducted a four‑hour session on September 21, from 11:00 to 15:00. Methods combined observation; high‑resolution stills; short video clips of mise‑en‑place through plating; brief “chef voice notes” per dish that identify origin, difficulty, and doneness criteria; and a semi‑structured interview with the owner‑chef, Mr. Shen Jiecheng. We captured 3D assets via two complementary pipelines: AI‑assisted meshes generated from canonical photograph angles, and LiDAR‑based USDZ scans with mobile tools. Highly glossy and steam‑prone surfaces, notably in 响油鳝糊, challenged LiDAR returns, which made the AI mesh pipeline the primary source for that dish (fieldworkreport.md).

4.3 Ethics
We obtained written consent from the owner that outlined use (course project, non‑commercial), pre‑publication review rights, privacy options for staff and patrons, and limits on recipe disclosure. Audio recording and image capture were limited to agreed windows outside peak service. The consent form also anticipated the owner’s right to withdraw any sensitive footage before public release (fieldworkreport.md).

4.4 Interview Themes
The interview, approximately twenty‑five minutes in duration, established the restaurant’s everyday positioning (“接地气”), continuity since the 1999 opening, an emphasis on freshness and sincerity, and pragmatic inclusion of a small set of spicier items to accommodate traveling patrons while keeping a Su cuisine core. Regarding 松鼠桂鱼, Mr. Shen identified three decisive competencies: precise knife work, deep‑fry shaping that holds form in oil, and a lively sweet‑sour sauce (“活卤”) that must be blended and finished correctly for gloss and balance.[^3]

5. Creative and Design Approach
The project’s creative intent is to make tacit kitchen knowledge legible without stripping it of its embodied, contingent character. We therefore designed the interface as a slow medium that resists skimming. Scroll‑gated annotations, paced reveals, and the coupling of text fragments to camera states on a 3D model encourage the viewer to align attention with technique. The goal is not only to “show” a dish, but to teach the viewer how to look. For instance, annotations are sequenced to move from knife preparation to oil behavior to sauce finishing, mirroring the chef’s own decision order. The interface does not simply accumulate facts; it choreographs perception.

Our initial visual system drew on shadcn/ui components that excel in commercial contexts, with dramatic gradients, parallax galleries, and ornamental hover effects. While visually compelling, this ensemble sometimes produced promotional overtones that felt at odds with a research‑first mission. We are therefore revising the typographic hierarchy, palette, and motion language toward clarity and sobriety. Large display faces now give way to a calmer serif–sans pairing; gradients are subdued; and hover interactions serve disclosure rather than spectacle. This shift is not merely aesthetic. It aligns the rhetoric of the interface with the ethics of documentation: to foreground source transparency, citation, and method.

Beyond typography and layout, the design prioritizes bilingual legibility and terminology that respects Su cuisine’s internal vocabulary. Key technical terms appear in Chinese with concise English glosses to preserve nuance. Where culinary metaphors risk flattening meaning in translation, we anchor claims in the owner’s phrasing and in observable cues on video. Visual density is managed so that each page supports two concurrent reading paths: a linear narrative that moves from context to technique to reflection, and a modular path in which visitors can pause on individual media objects. In both paths, microinteractions communicate state changes gently, signaling that the site is a study space rather than a showroom.

The creative strategy also treats the 3D model as an interpretive instrument rather than a literal surrogate for food. We do not aim for photorealism for its own sake. Rather, we emphasize the affordances of 3D to slow down inspection, reveal occluded angles, and attach narrative hotspots to material details that matter, such as the fish’s knife lattice or the viscosity of a glaze at a specific temperature. This approach reframes 3D as a way to cultivate observational literacy. It also acknowledges, following work on “handmade narrations,” that hands and hand‑like manipulations are central to culinary culture; by inviting the visitor’s hand through rotation and zoom, we intentionally evoke an embodied mode of learning that recalls studio pedagogy in craft.[^1]

6. Technical Implementation
The site is implemented with Next.js 15 (App Router) and React 19 in TypeScript. React Three Fiber and the drei helpers manage 3D scenes with GLTF/GLB assets produced from the dual capture pipeline. Styling relies on Tailwind CSS with a restrained subset of shadcn/ui components. Framer Motion provides animation primitives used sparingly to synchronize the appearance of annotations with scroll position. We adopted a static‑generation strategy to avoid server dependencies and to facilitate archiving. Dish detail pages are parametrized routes with statically generated paths; their content is read from a typed data module that stores bilingual names, descriptive prose, chef notes, and media references. This structure ensures reproducibility and simplifies future deposit in institutional repositories.

Because 3D assets can be heavy, we devote significant engineering effort to performance. Intersection Observers gate the mounting of canvases so that off‑screen scenes consume no resources. We rely on React Suspense and error boundaries to manage loading states gracefully, and we aggressively clean caches on unmount. Models are cloned to avoid material sharing bugs when multiple instances are present. For scenes without active interaction, we switch the render loop to a demand‑driven mode, reducing GPU workload while preserving responsiveness. These strategies allow the site to run at stable frame rates on mid‑range devices without sacrificing clarity of detail where it matters, such as the knife lattice on the squirrel fish’s surface.

7. Findings
Observationally, decision criteria across dishes are encoded in visible and tactile signals: bubble size and tempo in oil, glaze viscosity and clarity at the moment of nappe, the alignment and thickness of knife cuts, and fingertip tackiness tests that register surface starch development. The owner named these cues in the interview, and we recorded them across footage in ways that can be referenced in the interface. In the kitchen’s micro‑geographies, the division between prep, steam and stew, sauté, and plating organizes labor and constrains documentation. Narrow aisles, heat, and steam limited tripod placement and shot stability and necessitated compact rigs and non‑intrusive angles. These constraints, while limiting, also disciplined the project toward precision: we learned to select vantage points that show consequential details rather than generic action.

The market adaptation evident at Acheng Fandian—maintaining a Su cuisine core while adding a small repertoire of spicier items—reflects a hospitality ethic that is inclusive without dissolving identity. The owner’s emphasis on freshness “as the first gate to guard” operates as a craft value rather than a branding slogan. We treat this value as a curatorial principle: footage and 3D assets privilege material truth over excessive post‑processing, so that viewers can assess knife textures, oil sheens, and microbubbles for themselves.[^3]

8. Cultural Significance
The cultural significance of the project lies in its articulation of a preservation practice that is at once local, embodied, and replicable. By documenting Acheng Fandian at the threshold of intergenerational transfer, we attend to the fragile infrastructures through which taste is reproduced: seasonal sourcing, the patience of mise‑en‑place, and the rhythm of service that calibrates technique to the day’s variability. The micro‑museum foregrounds a category of culinary heritage that often escapes institutional attention because it is ordinary and ongoing rather than spectacular. In this sense, the site contributes a counter‑archive to platformized food culture, where virality favors novelty over continuity.

The interface’s encouragement of hand‑based exploration aligns with arguments from human–food interaction that hands are not merely instruments but mediators of meaning. By letting visitors “handle” a dish virtually, we create a bridge between the viewer’s sensorimotor intuition and the kitchen’s tacit criteria.[^1] At the same time, the project’s translation of ephemeral, processual knowledge into manipulable media echoes heritage work that reconstructs absent or inaccessible practices through contemporary technologies. Our approach adapts that logic to edible culture, using 3D not to monumentalize an object but to stabilize a way of seeing that might otherwise disappear with a retiring chef.[^2]

Importantly, the project also positions neighborhood restaurants as stewards of cultural memory. Acheng Fandian’s narrative—1999 establishment, steady service to local elders, pragmatic adjustments to market taste—testifies to how culinary identities persist under pressure. By structuring the site as a referenceable resource that educators, researchers, and younger cooks can use, we offer a template for community‑led preservation. The hope is that similar micro‑museums could be developed around other kitchens, forming a distributed, interoperable documentation of regional cuisines that captures diversity across methods and idioms.

9. Limitations
Several constraints shape the present outcome. We planned intergenerational patron interviews on‑site to capture community memory but could not execute them within the time and energy available. The social history layer is therefore incomplete. The kitchen’s size and heat limited video capture to short clips, and glossy, steaming dishes reduced LiDAR stability, narrowing 3D fidelity for some assets. The head chef’s preference for privacy shifted the balance of narration toward the owner’s perspective, which may emphasize managerial and didactic frames. Finally, the initial visual language borrowed too heavily from commercial sites, an overreach we are now correcting to better align tone with research goals.

10. Discussion
The project’s primary contribution is to demonstrate that a careful blend of fieldwork and web‑native interactivity can capture and transmit fragile culinary knowledge at neighborhood scale. Rather than isolating recipes, we connect technique to space, time, and decision cues in a way that supports both scholarly citation and lay learning. The site’s narrative pacing and embodied manipulation draw on research showing that hand‑based interaction deepens cultural understanding; we extend that insight by making the 3D model a pedagogical instrument that trains the eye and hand together.[^1] Technically, we show that performant static builds can deliver manipulable 3D alongside annotated media on commodity devices, suggesting a viable path for community organizations with limited resources.

Where the work falls short of the initial vision is equally instructive. We set out to produce a richer social portrait through community interviews and to conduct a full‑day longitudinal capture from supply intake through closing. These remain priorities for the next phase. We also learned that design rhetoric matters: ornamental componentry can overshadow method if it evokes promotion rather than study. Our ongoing revisions treat interface writing as part of method, naming sources explicitly, citing interview claims, and clarifying the interpretive status of reconstructions.

11. Conclusion and Future Work
This micro‑museum demonstrates how interactive design can render tacit culinary practice legible without reducing it to spectacle. By anchoring documentation in a single, ordinary restaurant at a moment of transition, we foreground the everyday infrastructures of taste and the labor that sustains them. The project contributes a replicable pattern for digital preservation that balances sensory access with scholarly clarity, and it offers a set of implementation practices—typed content models, static generation, viewport‑aware rendering—that can travel beyond this case.

Future work proceeds along three lines. First, we will produce a full‑day documentary of Acheng Fandian that traces supply chains, mise‑en‑place, line rhythm, guest interaction, and closing routines, thereby capturing temporalities beyond our four‑hour window. Second, we will conduct community interviews across age cohorts to surface social memory and to test how the site can host layered narratives from patrons as well as staff. Third, we will iterate capture methods to improve 3D fidelity, including cross‑polarized lighting and controlled humidity, while continuing to refine copy and layout toward a research‑first voice. In parallel, we will package media and metadata for deposit in an institutional repository and publish implementation notes so that similar sites can adopt the model with minimal friction.
